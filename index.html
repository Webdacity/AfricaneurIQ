                <p>AfricaneurIQ (Pty) Ltd (AIQ) was established in 2014 when its founding members became disillusioned
                    with the status quo of white-owned traditional incubators who have been cannibalizing the ED and SD
                    budgets of large corporates to enrich themselves instead of delivering sustainable black economic
                    empowerment by shifting significant preferential procurement of their clients to authentic and
                    deserving level 1 and 2 Black-owned EME and QSE businesses.
                </p>
                <div></div>
                <p>
                    AIQ developed the RESET model which it now utilizes to shift billions of rands worth of procurement
                    towards its Beneficiaries, who are properly developed, strategically capacitated and adequately
                    funded. AIQ works closely with the South African Department of Trade and Industry’s Black Industrial
                    Support program to expedite black economic empowerment for the benefit of all South Africans. </p>

            <div class="grid-text">
                <p>AIQ is able to rapidly and authentically transform the supply chain of any blue-chip company in
                    order to realize the spirit of economic transformation and go beyond simple compliance.
                </p>
                <div></div>
                <p>
                    By leveraging Preferential Procurement and harnessing the concessions afforded to black
                    entrepreneurs as legislated through Enterprise Development and Supplier Development, AIQ is
                    uniquely capable to develop and capacitate black-owned start-ups that are then able to compete
                    head-to-head on price, quality and service with some of the biggest historical generic suppliers
                    and displace them with absolutely zero delivery risk to the blue-chip corporate. All of this
                    within the first year of operation.
                </p>
                <div></div>
                <p>
                    Very importantly the AIQ Beneficiaries, who are level 1 BO EME’s and QSE’s are suppliers of
                    those commodities, products and services usually found in the top 20 suppliers-by value, of
                    blue-chip companies. That is where real transformation is desperately required and where it
                    really matters.
                </p>

                <p>AIQ’s goal for 2022 is to deliver the following:
                    10 Beneficiaries that the meet JSE listing requirements with turnover exceeding R1bn p.a.
                    20 Beneficiaries that have an annual turnover of over R500m p.a.
                    100 Beneficiaries that have an annual turnover of over R50m p.a.
                </p>
                <div></div>
                <p>
                    AIQ is ever mindful that company turnover is not the only key measure of success however should we
                    achieve the goals above it would mean that AIQ was able to shift a cumulative R25bn in procurement
                    towards our Level 1 and 2 EME and QSE start-up beneficiaries which would be a phenomenal
                    achievement.
